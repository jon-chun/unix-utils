**Troubleshooting GPU issues**

It sounds like after switching to Debian and updating, the NVIDIA drivers might have been upgraded, causing Ollama to stop using the GPU. Apt upgrade could have updated the NVIDIA drivers, leading to mismatches with CUDA. The simplest solution might be to reboot, which would reload the kernel modules properly. You can check the status with nvidia-smi or systemctl status nvidia-hydra. Just make sure the OLLAMA\_USE\_GPU environment variable is set when restarting Ollama with the GPU flag.

**Providing troubleshooting steps**

To fix this GPU issue, follow these steps:

1. Quick checks: reboot, ensure driver is loaded with `nvidia-smi`, and check Ollama logs for GPU usage.
2. Diagnostics:

   * Run `nvidia-smi` to check driver.
   * Use `cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version`.
   * Restart Ollama and monitor with `nvidia-smi`.
3. If necessary, set the `OLLAMA_ORCA_CUDA` variable, or reboot to reload drivers properly.

For future updates: Pin NVIDIA driver packages with `apt-mark hold` to prevent auto-updates and avoid mismatches.

**Future-proofing Docker & NVIDIA setup**

To protect your Ollama, Docker, and NVIDIA setup during future upgrades, consider using tools like `apt-mark` hold or an apt preference file to pin specific package versions. Using Ubuntu's 'Pro' stable updates or pinning Docker images can further stabilize things. It's also handy to pin GPU drivers from the graphics-driver PPA. Lastly, setting up a separate environment for development or using virtualization can add extra layers of security against disruptions.


**Protecting setup during upgrades**

For future upgrades, use tools like `apt-mark hold` or `apt preferences` to pin specific versions and avoid unwanted updates. Docker images can also be pinned for stability, and GPU drivers from the graphics-drivers PPA should be held. You may need `ubuntu-drivers devices` to manage drivers properly. Consider creating a separate development environment or using virtualization as added protection. As a quick recourse, consider restoring specific driver versions with `apt install` commands.


**Troubleshooting GPU usage**

It looks like the GPU might not be used due to a driver mismatch or not being loaded. This could be because a reboot is needed, or the nvidia-container-toolkit isn't integrated. To check:

1. Ensure the driver is loaded; run `nvidia-smi`. If it fails, reboot or reinstall the driver.
2. Check `/usr/bin/nvidia-ctk runtime list` and confirm environment variables like `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`.
3. Test with `ollama run llama3` and check `nvidia-smi`. If issues persist, check logs with `OLLAMA_DEBUG=1 ollama serve`.


**Upgrades Protection and GPU Setup**

It looks like the ‚Äúcould not load libcuda.so‚Äù error might happen if the path to `libcuda.so.1` is missing. First, confirm the existence of `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.1`. For Docker, make sure to mount NVIDIA libraries correctly. You should add your user to the Docker group and check Docker with `docker info`.

For upgrades: Consider using `apt-mark hold` to lock the NVIDIA driver or use package version control. You can also freeze the kernel to avoid mismatches, and back up with Timeshift. Virtualization could also help unify your setup.


Thought for 1m 17s


**Executive‚Äësummary**

\*‚ÄØYour VS‚ÄØCode switch itself can‚Äôt disable Ollama‚Äôs CUDA path; what changed is that `apt upgrade` likely **installed a newer NVIDIA kernel‚Äëmodule/userspace pair that isn‚Äôt active until a reboot**.
\*‚ÄØA single reboot (or at least a full `modprobe nvidia` cycle + Docker restart) normally restores GPU visibility.
\*‚ÄØTo keep future `apt upgrade` runs from ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù you, pin the exact driver/kernel pair you know is stable and tell unattended‚Äëupgrades to ignore them. The same trick works for Docker + nvidia‚Äëcontainer‚Äëtoolkit and for Ollama‚Äôs own package.

Below you‚Äôll find:

1. a 2‚Äëminute checklist to bring the GPU back right now,
2. verification commands,
3. safe‚Äëupgrade playbook for the long run.

## 2‚ÄØ‚ÄØ|‚ÄØConfirm Ollama really sees CUDA

```bash
# Bare‚Äëmetal install:
ollama serve --debug 2>&1 | grep -i cuda

# Docker:
docker exec -it ollama nvidia-smi
docker logs ollama | grep -i "Dynamic LLM libraries"
```

A healthy log line looks like:

````
Dynamic LLM libraries [cuda_v11 rocm_v60002 cpu cpu_avx ...] üü¢
``` :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

If you instead see *‚ÄúCUDA disabled ‚Äì falling back to CPU‚Äù* or nothing about `cuda_v11`, Ollama still can‚Äôt open `libcuda.so` ‚Üí double‚Äëcheck `nvidia-smi`, driver version, and that you didn‚Äôt upgrade to the **555¬†beta** driver (known to break Ollama)¬†:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## 3‚ÄØ‚ÄØ|‚ÄØWhy upgrades sometimes break GPU apps

1. **Driver / kernel mismatch** ‚Äì `apt upgrade` pulls in a newer NVIDIA userspace but the matching DKMS module isn‚Äôt compiled until the next boot.  
2. **nvidia‚Äëcontainer‚Äëtoolkit version skew** ‚Äì Docker‚Äôs GPU runtime has to match the installed driver ABI.  
3. **CUDA minor version gating inside Ollama** ‚Äì releases before *0.1.38* refused driver¬†‚â•‚ÄØ555.¬†:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
4. **Kernel upgrades** ‚Äì a new `linux-image-6.xx‚Ä¶` invalidates the currently compiled DKMS module.

---

## 4‚ÄØ‚ÄØ|‚ÄØLong‚Äëterm hardening: freeze what matters

> The goal is *predictability*‚Äîyou decide when to take a new driver, kernel, or Ollama build.

### 4.1  Pin the driver & kernel

```bash
# Find the exact versions you‚Äôre happy with
dpkg -l | grep nvidia-driver
uname -r

# Freeze them
sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-driver-535 nvidia-kernel-common-535 \
                   nvidia-kernel-source-535 nvidia-dkms-535 \
                   linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
````

Later, to upgrade on your own terms:

```bash
sudo apt-mark unhold nvidia-driver-*  # upgrade, test, then hold again
```

### 4.2  Pin Docker‚Äôs GPU toolkit

```bash
sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-container-toolkit nvidia-container-runtime
```

### 4.3  Exclude in unattended‚Äëupgrades

Edit `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`:

```text
Package-Blacklist {
    "nvidia-driver-535";
    "nvidia-kernel-common-535";
    "linux-image-generic";
    "nvidia-container-toolkit";
    "ollama";
};
```

### 4.4  Snapshot before big jumps

* Use **Timeshift** or `btrfs` snapshots (desktop) or a VM/LXC clone (server) before unfreezing anything major.
* Keep a copy of the working driver in `/var/cache/apt/archives/` (`apt-get download nvidia-driver-535`).

---

## 5‚ÄØ‚ÄØ|‚ÄØUpgrade playbook (copy‚Äëpaste for next time)

```bash
# 0. Create snapshot / timeshift
# 1. Unhold packages you want to test
sudo apt-mark unhold nvidia-driver-* nvidia-container-toolkit ollama

# 2. Simulate upgrade
apt-get -s dist-upgrade | less

# 3. Do the real upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

# 4. Reboot and verify
nvidia-smi
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base nvidia-smi
ollama run llama3:8b -p "hi" | head

# 5. If everything is fine, hold again
sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-driver-* nvidia-container-toolkit ollama
```

---

### ‚úÖ  What to remember

1. **Reboot after any driver or kernel change**‚Äîit‚Äôs the simplest fix for ‚ÄúCUDA vanished‚Äù.
2. **Pin driver + toolkit + kernel** to avoid accidental mismatches.
3. **Upgrade in a controlled window**, snapshot first, and you‚Äôll keep your RTX¬†3090‚Äëpowered Ollama stack humming regardless of what Ubuntu‚Äôs next `apt upgrade` throws your way.

Feel free to let me know if any step still leaves the GPU idle‚Äîthere are deeper diagnostics (like checking `/proc/driver/nvidia/version` or `ldd $(which ollama) | grep cuda`) we can run if needed. Happy (stable) hacking!

Looking at the system information you provided, I notice you're using Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) with NVIDIA components and CUDA installed. This additional context helps me tailor my troubleshooting approach for your VSCode crashing issue. Let me provide step-by-step instructions to diagnose and fix the problem.

# Step 1: Check for conflicts with NVIDIA drivers

Based on your system output, you have multiple NVIDIA repositories configured, including some for Ubuntu 18.04 that might conflict with your current 22.04 installation:

1. First, check your current NVIDIA driver:
   ```
   nvidia-smi
   ```

2. If you see any errors or outdated drivers, update your NVIDIA drivers through the recommended Ubuntu repository:
   ```
   sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535  # Use the latest recommended version
   ```

# Step 2: Fix repository duplications

Your system shows several duplicate repository entries which might cause conflicts:

1. Clean up duplicate Docker repositories:
   ```
   sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/archive_uri-https_download_docker_com_linux_ubuntu-jammy.list
   ```

2. Clean up duplicate CUDA repositories:
   ```
   sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-official.list
   ```

3. Update your package lists:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

# Step 3: Launch VSCode with diagnostics

Let's gather more information about the crashes:

1. Launch VSCode with verbose logging:
   ```
   code --verbose --log=debug
   ```

2. If it crashes, check the logs:
   ```
   cat ~/.config/Code/logs/*/renderer.log
   cat ~/.config/Code/logs/*/window1/renderer.log
   ```

# Step 4: Disable GPU acceleration

Given your NVIDIA setup, GPU acceleration might be causing conflicts:

1. Launch VSCode with GPU acceleration disabled:
   ```
   code --disable-gpu
   ```

2. If this resolves the issue, make it permanent by creating/editing a custom desktop entry:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
   cp /usr/share/applications/code.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
   sed -i 's/Exec=\/usr\/share\/code\/code/Exec=\/usr\/share\/code\/code --disable-gpu/g' ~/.local/share/applications/code.desktop
   ```

# Step 5: Check for extension conflicts

Since you're in a development environment (noticed from your conda base environment), extensions might be causing issues:

1. Launch VSCode in safe mode:
   ```
   code --disable-extensions
   ```

2. If VSCode is stable in safe mode, identify problematic extensions:
   - Enable extensions one by one, starting with ones related to Python, Docker, or NVIDIA/CUDA
   - After enabling each extension, restart VSCode and test

# Step 6: Update VSCode to the latest version

Make sure you're using the latest VSCode version:

1. Download the latest .deb package from the official website:
   ```
   wget -O ~/Downloads/code_latest.deb "https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64"
   ```

2. Install it:
   ```
   sudo apt install ~/Downloads/code_latest.deb
   ```

# Step 7: Fix potential Electron sandbox issues

Some VSCode crashes on Ubuntu are related to Electron sandbox issues:

1. Create or edit the VSCode launch script:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   echo '#!/bin/bash
   /usr/bin/code --no-sandbox "$@"' > ~/.local/bin/vscode
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/vscode
   ```

2. Use this custom launcher:
   ```
   ~/.local/bin/vscode
   ```

# Step 8: Check system memory and swap

Given your development environment, memory issues might be causing crashes:

1. Check your available memory:
   ```
   free -h
   ```

2. If memory is low, increase your swap space:
   ```
   sudo swapoff -a
   sudo fallocate -l 8G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   ```

3. Make it permanent by adding to fstab:
   ```
   echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

# Step 9: Reset VSCode user data as a last resort

If all else fails, you can reset VSCode completely (backup your settings first):

1. Back up your settings:
   ```
   cp -r ~/.config/Code ~/.config/Code.backup
   ```

2. Remove VSCode data:
   ```
   rm -rf ~/.config/Code
   rm -rf ~/.vscode
   ```

3. Reinstall VSCode:
   ```
   sudo apt remove --purge code
   sudo apt install ~/Downloads/code_latest.deb
   ```

Try these steps methodically, testing VSCode after each significant change. The most likely culprits based on your system configuration are NVIDIA driver conflicts and duplicate repository issues. If the issue persists, let me know which steps you've tried and what the results were.
